When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?
Using a remote repository is useful when multiple users are making
contributions or one user is using multiple machines to edit files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Automatically pulling changes might interfere with the user's current 
work so manual is preferred.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When 
would you use one instead of another?
Forks are used to point back to someone else's repositories and
give credit. Clones are used to copy a repository onto the user's 
machine. Branches are used to start a new line of editing that 
doesn't affect other branches.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of 
the remote stored locally?
The user might be able to resolve merge and resolve conflicts before
pushing changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be 
easier, and what would be harder?
Collaborating wothout using Git or GitHub would be slow and require 
very careful editing while merging would be difficult and tedious.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than
directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Making changes in a separate branch can be beneficial when you want 
other collaborators comment on possible changes that the user does not 
want to include on the master branch just yet. Editing on the master branch
is easier since there are no pull request but it is more risky because it 
might break the master.
