When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?
Using a remote repository is useful when multiple users are making
contributions or one user is using multiple machines to edit files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Automatically pulling changes might interfere with the user's current 
work so manual is preferred.
