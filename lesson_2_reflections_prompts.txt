What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do 
you need to do it?
Initializing a repository begins a new git repo to start
to save your files. Without a repository you cannot use git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows the user to make commits for different
file(s) that may be related and leave out others that aren't 
while in the same directory.
