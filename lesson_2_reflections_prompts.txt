What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do 
you need to do it?
Initializing a repository begins a new git repo to start
to save your files. Without a repository you cannot use git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows the user to make commits for different
file(s) that may be related and leave out others that aren't 
while in the same directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one 
commit per logical change?
The staging area can be used to see the differences in the file(s) 
so that the user can see the if the change warrants a commit or 
needs more work.
